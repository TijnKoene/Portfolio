            <p>Hello, I'm Tijn Koene, a 17-year-old student currently in my second year of software development at Sint
                Lucas. I live in Breda <br> a city in the Netherlands and my study is in Eindhoven.
                I love the sport rugby, <br>where I've learned the values of teamwork and perseverance. <br>
                <br>
                When the weekend arrives, you'll often find me with my friends, going out in Eindhoven as well as in Breda <br> and creating memories
                together. I love the excitement of parties and the joy of socializing with friends.<br>
                <br>
                Beyond the world of social gatherings, I'm deeply passionate about two things: game design and web
                development. <br>Crafting game worlds that fascinate players, user-friendly websites are my creative
                outlets. I'm always seeking new <br>challenges and opportunities to expand my skills in these areas.
                <br> <br>
                Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or
                collaborate on exciting projects.</p>
