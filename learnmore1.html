        <h2>The assignment</h2>
        <p>The assignment we needed to make a 2D game with a list of requirements. I chose for a mario type of game
            where you can collect crystals kill enemy’s and try to get to the end of the level.</p>
        <h2>The Enemy’s</h2>
        There are four different kind of enemy’s two of them can fly and the other two can only move on the ground. They
        deal damage when you collide with them and when you receive damage u see your health bar go down till its empty
        then you get the game over screen. You can shoot at them by clicking LMB until they die. I also added healing
        items that if you pick them op you get some health back.
