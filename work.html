            <h1>Work</h1>
            <p>At this moment I work in a small restaurant called Gusto Di Pol. It is a italian restaurant where you can eat pizza's, pasta's and go eat a icecream there is also a little shop where you can buy italian snacks like canolli's. My job there is waiting tables most of the time. Sometimes they need me in the kitchen or at the bar I have no problem doing that, but I love the interaction with the guests as waiter. Normally I work 2 nights a week after school and in te weekend. My colleges are very nice most of them are my friends and we also hang out outside of work, because we are al the same age its more fun and there is more of a click. I've now worked there for more then a year and still really enjoy working there. </p>
